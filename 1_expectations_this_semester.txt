Introduction: 
My name is Astrid Borja, 23 years old, from the province of laguna. I’m an enthusiastic student eager to further my understanding of backend development. I have some experience with programming, particularly in languages like Python and JavaScript. I've worked on smaller web development projects, using frameworks such as Flask for Python, but I’m relatively new to backend-focused development. My main interest lies in understanding the architecture behind web applications and building systems that interact with databases, handle requests, and provide real-time functionality. I have some basic knowledge of Node.js but am excited to dive deeper into it and learn how to use it effectively in building scalable, efficient backend services.

Course Expectations: In this course, I want to build a solid foundation in backend development and acquire hands-on experience working with Node.js, Express, and other relevant technologies. I’m particularly excited about learning how to design and develop robust APIs, handle HTTP requests, manage authentication, and implement security measures like data validation and protection from SQL injection. I believe mastering these skills will be crucial for my future career in full-stack development, as backend functionality is the backbone of every modern web application. Additionally, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of databases—both SQL and NoSQL—and how to efficiently integrate them with backend services.
Beyond technical skills, I’m hoping to improve my problem-solving abilities and my approach to debugging and troubleshooting backend issues. Understanding backend architecture will also give me a broader perspective on how the frontend and backend interact and how to design applications that are scalable, maintainable, and performant.


Challenges and Areas for Improvement: One area I expect to be challenging is working with databases, particularly optimizing queries for performance and ensuring data integrity when handling complex relationships. I’ve worked with simple databases before, but I feel that I could use more practice in writing efficient queries and working with ORMs. Additionally, building RESTful APIs and managing authentication mechanisms like JWT and OAuth are areas where I could improve. I’ve encountered some difficulties while trying to implement these features in previous projects, and I would like to overcome them in this course.
To address these challenges, I plan to dedicate extra time to practicing database design and query optimization. I will also explore tutorials and online resources related to API development and authentication mechanisms to strengthen my understanding of these topics. I believe that through hands-on projects, I’ll be able to overcome these hurdles and apply the knowledge effectively.

Expectations from the Instructor :   I would appreciate clear explanations of concepts, especially when introducing new technologies or tools. I also value coding examples, particularly real-world scenarios that can be applied to building actual web applications. It would be helpful to have access to tutorials or supplementary resources for practice between lessons. Additionally, feedback on assignments or projects is crucial to ensure I’m on the right track and to help me understand areas where I can improve. If possible, I would like the option for extra support or clarification during office hours or via email when I run into specific challenges.
Ultimately, I’m looking for a learning environment that encourages exploration and experimentation, with a balance of theory and hands-on practice.

Final Thoughts: I’m excited to deepen my backend development skills in this course and am eager to learn how to build real-world applications. My goal is to be able to develop a full-stack project by the end of the semester, where I can apply the skills and knowledge gained throughout the course. I’m open to feedback and want to challenge myself to step out of my comfort zone to improve as a developer.
