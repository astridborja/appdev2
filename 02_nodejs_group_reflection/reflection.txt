Reflection 2 

Your Role: 

My role for our project this semester is UI/UX Designer. What I contributed to our group is by giving ideas, and creating the design of our system. One of the challenges that I’ve encountered throughout the first semester was when I had experienced what you’d call “artist block”. There were times when I had difficulty on designing some of our system’s page, and it took me hours to came up with one. But with this experience, i’ve learned to expand my knowledge with design and how to make it more pleasing to the eyes while meeting the standards of our system requirements.


Teamwork Experience: 

At first, teaming up with my current group feels foreign for me since I am not that close with some of the members. But whilst working with them, I’ve learned to communicate with everyone and learned to reach out my concerns without hassle. Every member of our group created a hassle-free working environment, and it helped us, me especially, to work well with our project. 


Personal Growth and Discipline: 

As a UI/UX Designer, I firstly want to improve my designing techniques more. I hope that throughout this semester I will hone my skills more to prepare me in the future. I also want to improve my communicating skills since sometimes, I held myself back from communicating my concerns and ideas; not because of my groups, but because of personal issues. I will surely work on that matter. Lastly, is my time management since I had sometimes difficulty on managing my time, resulting me to have conflicts on deadlines and compromising the quality of my work.
